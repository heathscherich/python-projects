__Modify the contents of the `contents` folder to include the notebooks you want to distribute as part of your distribution.__

*You can do this by clicking on the `contents` directory and dragging notebooks from your desktop onto the contents listing. Wait for the files to be uploaded and then save them ("commit" them) to the `main` branch of the repository.*

Check that you have Github Pages enabled for your repository: from your repository [*Settings*](./settings) tab, select the [*Pages*](./settings/pages) menu item and ensure that the source is set to `gh-pages`.

When you commit a file, an updated release will be built and published on the Github Pages site. Note that it may take a few minutes for the Github Pages site to be updated. Do a hard refresh on your Github Pages site in your web browser to see the new release.
